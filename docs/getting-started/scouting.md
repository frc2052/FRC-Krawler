# Scouting
Scouting is the core purpose of FRC Krawler, so you've come to the right place!

Once you have [set up a game, event, and metric sets](setup.md), either 
[started a server](scouting-with-server.md) or chosen to [scout solo](solo-scouting.md), 
you are ready to begin scouting.

## Match scouting
When match scouting you can use the "-" and "+" buttons at the top of the screen to change which 
match you are scouting, and you can use the team dropdown to change which team you are entering
data for.

Below that you will see the inputs for each metric you have defined in your metric set.

!!! Warning
    Be sure to save all the data you have input before moving on to a new team or match!

## Pit scouting
Pit scouting is nearly identical to match scouting - the primary difference is that you do not have
a match number selector.
