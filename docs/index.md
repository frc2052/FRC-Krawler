# FRC Krawler Documentation
FRC Krawler is an Android scouting application for the _FIRST_ Robotics Competition. It is developed 
by FRC Team 2052 - KnightKrawler from New Brighton, Minnesota.

FRC Krawler is open source, offline-first, and is designed to be easy to use while being
highly customizable to support gathering a wide variety of data to enable teams to make data-driven
decisions during alliance selection.

## Device requirements
FRC Krawler is only available for Android devices, and currently supports **Android 8.0 and above**. 
An older version (3.3.10) of the app is still available that supports Android 5.0 and up. It functions
quite similarly to the latest version, but the two are not compatible with each other (you can't run a 
modern version of the app on one device and 3.3.10 on another), and there are some UI differences 
between the two.

FRC Krawler also requires bluetooth if you plan to use multiple devices. If you plan to do all scouting
from a single device, bluetooth is not required.

Most users of FRC Krawler run the app on relatively inexpensive Android tablets, such as Amazon Kindle
Fire tablets (note that if you go the Kindle Fire route, you will need to sideload the Google Play 
Store to the tablets). 

FRC Krawler is primarily designed to be used in a multi-device setup where one device acts as a 
server and other devices (scouts) sync their scouting data back to the server periodically. The server
device combines the data from all scouts and can export that data for further analysis. The server 
can also contribute scouting data.
