It is developed  by FRC Team 2052 - KnightKrawler from New Brighton, Minnesota.</p> <p>FRC Krawler is open source, offline-first, and is designed to be easy to use while being highly customizable to support gathering a wide variety of data to enable teams to make data-driven decisions during alliance selection.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#device-requirements","title":"Device requirements","text":"<p>FRC Krawler is only available for Android devices, and currently supports Android 8.0 and above.  An older version (3.3.10) of the app is still available that supports Android 5.0 and up. It functions quite similarly to the latest version, but the two are not compatible with each other (you can\u2019t run a  modern version of the app on one device and 3.3.10 on another), and there are some UI differences  between the two.</p> <p>FRC Krawler also requires bluetooth if you plan to use multiple devices. If you plan to do all scouting from a single device, bluetooth is not required.</p> <p>Most users of FRC Krawler run the app on relatively inexpensive Android tablets, such as Amazon Kindle Fire tablets (note that if you go the Kindle Fire route, you will need to sideload the Google Play  Store to the tablets). </p> <p>FRC Krawler is primarily designed to be used in a multi-device setup where one device acts as a  server and other devices (scouts) sync their scouting data back to the server periodically. The server device combines the data from all scouts and can export that data for further analysis. The server  can also contribute scouting data.</p>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Check out our Getting Started guide to get started!</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>Having an issue with FRC Krawler?
